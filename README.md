> [!CAUTION]
> **THIS REPOSITORY IS AN EDUCATIONAL EXAMPLE FOR LEARNING NGINX, REVERSE PROXY, AND NETWORK SECURITY BASICS. THIS SCRIPT DEMONSTRATES NGINX SETUP AS A REVERSE PROXY. NOT FOR PRODUCTION AND NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE! IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE CONTROL PANEL WORKS - THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, NOT THE SCRIPT AUTHOR'S. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

---

## Overview

This automation script simplifies the deployment of a reverse proxy server using NGINX and XRAY, as well as the installation of Remnawave control panel and node. The architecture is optimized for performance: Xray runs directly on port 443 and redirects traffic through a Unix socket that NGINX listens to, minimizing TCP overhead and improving connection reliability.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Debian and Ubuntu support. The script was tested in a KVM virtualization environment. For proper operation, you will need your own domain. It is recommended to run with root privileges on a freshly installed system.

### Deployment Modes

The script supports flexible deployment configurations:

**1. Single Server Mode**
- Control panel and XRAY node installed on one machine
- Suitable for compact installations with moderate traffic

**2. Distributed Mode**
- **Panel Server**: Management center without XRAY node
- **Node Server**: Hosts XRAY node with SelfSteal stub for VLESS REALITY

### Domain Requirements

Prepare three domains or subdomains before installation:

1. **Control Panel**: Access to management interface
2. **Subscription Page**: Client configuration distribution
3. **SelfSteal Stub**: Camouflage website hosted on node server

---

## Domain Setup

The script supports two methods for obtaining SSL certificates:
- **Cloudflare**: Management through Cloudflare API
- **ACME**: Direct integration with hosting provider

### DNS Configuration Examples

#### Single Server Installation (panel + node together)

| Record Type | Name              | Value            | Proxy Status |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| A           | example.com       | your_server_ip   | DNS only     |
| CNAME       | panel.example.com | example.com      | DNS only     |
| CNAME       | sub.example.com   | example.com      | DNS only     |
| CNAME       | node.example.com  | example.com      | DNS only     |

> [!TIP]
> The `node.example.com` record is optional for SelfSteal functionality. You can use the root domain `example.com` instead.

#### Distributed Installation (panel and node on different servers)

| Record Type | Name              | Value                | Proxy Status |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| A           | example.com       | panel_server_ip      | DNS only     |
| CNAME       | panel.example.com | example.com          | DNS only     |
| CNAME       | sub.example.com   | example.com          | DNS only     |
| A           | node.example.com  | node_server_ip       | DNS only     |

## Installation Guide

### Single Server Deployment

1. Run the installation script
2. Select **"Install Remnawave Components"**
3. Select **"Install panel and node on one server"**
4. Wait for completion
5. The script will automatically restart services and display login credentials

### Distributed Deployment

**Step 1: Panel Server Setup**

1. Run the installation script on the first server
2. Select **"Install Remnawave Components"**
3. Select **"Install panel only"**
4. Save the provided credentials

**Step 2: Certificate Export**

1. Log in to the control panel
2. Navigate to **Nodes** → **Management**
3. Select the target node
4. Find the **"Secret Key (SECRET_KEY)"** field
5. Copy the certificate using the copy icon

**Step 3: Node Server Setup**

1. Run the installation script on the second server
2. Select **"Install Remnawave Components"**
3. Select **"Install node only"**
4. Paste the certificate when prompted
5. Confirm the successful node connection message

## Security Features

### Panel Access Protection

NGINX configuration implements URL parameter-based authentication to protect against unauthorized discovery:

**Access Method**
```
https://panel.example.com/auth/login?<SECRET_KEY>=<SECRET_KEY>
```

**How It Works**

1. URL parameter automatically sets a cookie in the browser
   - Cookie name: `<SECRET_KEY>`
   - Cookie value: `<SECRET_KEY>`

2. Access requirements:
   - Valid cookie must be present
   - URL must contain correct parameter

3. Failed access behavior:
   - Missing cookie: Blank page or 404 error
   - Incorrect parameter: Blank page or 404 error

This protection level prevents:
- Host scanning discovery
- Path brute-force attacks
- Brute-force access attempts

The panel remains invisible without the correct authentication parameter.
