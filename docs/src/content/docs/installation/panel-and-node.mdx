:::danger[Warning]

:::danger[Warning]
After the installation is complete, the script will display a unique URL for logging into the control panel.  
**Be sure to save this URL.** It contains the secret key needed for access.

Example login link:
```
https://p.example.com/auth/login?SECRET_KEY=SECRET_KEY
```
Without this URL, **you will not be able** to log into the panel.
