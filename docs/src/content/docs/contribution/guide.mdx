## Installing Node.js and npm

To contribute to the Remnawave Reverse-proxy project, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download and install them from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Installing git

If you haven't already, install git on your system. You can find installation instructions on the [git official website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and downloads page on [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Cloning the Repository

<Steps>

1. To get started, clone the Remnawave Reverse-proxy repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/snaplyze/remnawave-reverse-proxy
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory

    ```bash
    cd remnawave-reverse-proxy/docs
    ```

</Steps>

## Installing Dependencies

<Steps>

1. Before you can build the documentation, you need to install the necessary dependencies. Run the following command in the `docs` directory.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. To build the documentation locally, run:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

</Steps>

This will start a local development server, and you can view the documentation at `http://localhost:4321`.

### 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

<FileTree>

- **docs** documentation source files
    - public/
    - src
        - assets/
            - en/
            - ru/
        - components/
        - **content/docs** root (en) documentation files
            - index.mdx
            - **ru/** i18n files
                - index.mdx
        - styles/
        - content.config.ts
- astro.config.mjs
- package.json
- tsconfig.json

</FileTree>

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

### 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
