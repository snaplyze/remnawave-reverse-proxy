## Adding mirrors for Docker

In some cases like [#40](https://github.com/snaplyze/remnawave-reverse-proxy/issues/40) servers, especially which are located in Russia, can't pull the images.  
To fix this issue, you can add mirrors:

<Steps>

1. Create `daemon.json` file:

    ```bash
    nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
    ```

2. Import mirrors

    ```json
    {
    "log-driver": "local",
    "registry-mirrors": [
        "https://mirror.gcr.io/",
        "https://dockerhub.timeweb.cloud"
        ]
    }
    ```

3. Restart Docker service to apply made changes

    ```bash
    systemctl restart docker
    ```

</Steps>

## You have reached your unauthenticated pull rate limit

If you see this message, it means you have exceeded the rate limit for unauthenticated requests to the Docker Hub. To resolve this issue, you can try one of the following solutions:

<Steps>

1. Authenticate with Docker Hub

    Log in to your Docker Hub account using the Docker CLI:

    ```bash
    docker login
    ```

2. Use a Different Network

    If possible, try switching to a different network to see if the issue persists. Or just ask your hosting provider to explain it.

3. Enable IPv6

    Run the script and select "7. Manage IPv6" and enable IPv6 support. This can help bypass some rate limits in some cases.

</Steps>
